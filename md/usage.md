This interactive web application allows you to interact and check how walking speed varies with slope of the path according to Tobler's hiking function. This function serves the basis of **W**alking **A**ccessibility **A**ssessment **T**ool (**WAAT**) developed by [Tang et. al (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1177/2399808320932575).

[Tobler's hiking function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobler%27s_hiking_function) is function that determines walking speed according to the slope of the path. The function is formulated using empirical data. The walking speed $W$ could be expressed as:

$$ W = Me^{-3.5 \\times \\left\\lvert tan \\theta + 0.05 \\right\\rvert} $$

Where $\\theta$ is the slope (in angle) and $M$ is maximum walking speed of that person.

### How to Use

1. Drag the slider to change the walking speed on flat terrain.
1. Hover on the plot on observe the relationship between gradient of the path and walking speed.

For reference, the flat terrain walking speed of a normal adult is **5 km/hr**. Older adults who are healthy generally will have walking speed around 3.24 - 4.68 km/hr.
