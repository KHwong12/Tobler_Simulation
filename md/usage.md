This interactive web application allows you to interact and check how walking speed varies with slope of the path according to Tobler's hiking function. This function serves the basis of **W**alking **A**ccessibility **A**ssessment **T**ool (WAAT) developed by [Tang et. al (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1177/2399808320932575).

[Tobler's hiking function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobler%27s_hiking_function) is function that determines walking speed according to the slope of the path. The function is formulated using empirical data. The walking speed $W$ could be expressed as:

$$ W = Me^{-3.5 \\times \\left\\lvert tan \\theta + 0.05 \\right\\rvert} $$

Where $\\theta$ is the slope and $M$ is maximum walking speed.

### How to Use

1. Drag the slider to change the walking speed on flat ground (*ground speed*).
1. Move along the plot on the right to observe the relationship.
1. Check the walking time for the selected paths below.

For reference, ground speed of a normal adult is 5 km/hr. Older adults who are healthy generally will have ground walking speed around 3.24 - 4.68 km/hr.
